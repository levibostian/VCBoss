 Class used by a UIViewController to manage presenting and dismissing of UIViewControllers in a safe way. iOS throws errors if you try to call `self.present()` inside of a UIViewController when another UIViewController is already being shown. Replace all of your existing `self.present()` calls with using VCBoss and be safe knowing only 1 ViewController will be shown at a time.
 
 Note: This class *does not* know about any UIViewControllers that you have already shown in it with `self.present()`. Make sure to place *all* existing `self.present()` calls with using VCBoss to assert you will not have any issues.
